# Cross-platform Design

Learn concepts and APIs which are usable across the dominant mobile platforms (iOS, Android, and Windows). Most courses in this track use Xamarin.Forms, but the concepts can also be applied to native development.

## Getting Started with Xamarin (XAM101)

What is Xamarin? How does Xamarin.Forms differ from Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS? What code can I share across my apps? Can I develop on Windows and macOS? This course answers these questions and more. By the end of the course, you will be able to choose the Xamarin approach that is right for you. You will also set up your development machine and run an app on Windows, the iOS simulator, and an Android emulator. 

- Describe the mobile Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) with Xamarin
- Install the Xamarin tools for Visual Studio
- Keep your development tools up to date

## Introduction to Cross-Platform Mobile Development (XAM110)

One of the advantages to using Xamarin over the traditional platform-specific approach is the level of code-sharing you can achieve across iOS, Android, and Windows. In this class, we will explore ways to structure your shared code using Portable Class Libraries, .NET Standard libraries, and Shared Asset Projects. We will look at the pros and cons of each approach and see how to access platform-specific features in each model.

- Work with shared packages from NuGet
- Use Shared Projects to share code between platforms
- Use Portable Class Libraries to share code between platforms
- Share code using .NET Standard libraries
