# Introduction to F#

This track provides an introduction to the F# programming language. This set of modules provides experienced C# developers with the knowledge they need to start programming in F#.

## Introduction to C# [CSC101]

Functional languages use the principle of data immutability to avoid variables that maintain state. This characteristic makes functional programs easier to validate and easier to execute in multithreaded or parallel-processing environments. This module introduces you to the F# functional programming language. You will see how to code a simple F# program and execute it using a command-line interpreter called the Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL). 

- Know the role of C# and Xamarin
- Set up and run your first program
- Learn the fundamentals of F#

##  Projects in F# [FSC102]

To build a real-world F# application you will use a development environment to create a project and organize your source code into multiple files. You will want to integrate 3rd-party libraries and code your own custom types. This module takes you through the entire process of using Visual Studio to create and run an F# console application.

##  [FSC101]

Managing in-memory data is required in most apps and F# contains powerful data-storage and processing APIs to help you. The APIs are optimized for specific use-cases; for example, some work best if your data is static while others are intended for large data sets. This course shows you several common F# data structures and discusses the pros and cons of each. By the end of the course, you will be able to choose the right storage option for your application.
